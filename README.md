# Project1_3345

First Project completed in Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis (CS 3345).
Purpose of the project is to test which sort is faster in terms of different types and sizes of arrays.
The user inputs the number of random numbers to put into the array, and then selects whether the array should be In Order, Reverse Order, Almost In Order,
or Random. 
This project helped me learn about the different types of sorting including BucketSort, HeapSort, InsertionSort, SelectionSort, QuickSort, MergeSort, and RadixSort.
